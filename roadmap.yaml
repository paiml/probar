        acceptance_criteria:
          - YAML schema validates all playbooks
          - State machine rejects orphaned states
          - All transitions have explicit triggers

    name: "Tarantula Fault Localization Integration"
    status: in_progress

      Five-Whys analysis from whisper.apr revealed critical gaps in probador
      that allowed 97 compile errors to go undetected. This milestone addresses
      those gaps with compile-first gates, version sync, and diagnostic modes.
    tickets:
      - id: PROBAR-006
        title: "Compile-First Gate for probar test"
        description: |
          Run `cargo test --no-run` before executing playbooks to catch compile
          errors early. This prevents the situation where broken test files
          don't block playbook execution.

          COMPLETED: Implemented in main.rs run_tests() function.
          - Added skip_compile field to TestArgs in commands.rs
          - Runs `cargo test --no-run` before playbooks
          - Shows first error and suggests `--skip-compile` bypass
          - Verbose mode shows compile check progress

          Root cause: whisper.apr's probar_full_stack.rs had 97 compile errors
          referencing non-existent types, but `probar test` still "passed"
          because it only runs browser playbooks.
        priority: critical
        status: completed
        completed_at: "2026-01-07"
        acceptance_criteria:
          - `probar test` runs `cargo test --no-run` before playbooks ✓
          - `probar test --skip-compile` bypasses compile check ✓
          - Compile errors cause immediate test failure ✓
          - Error message shows which crate failed to compile ✓
        five_whys:
          why1: "Tests with 97 errors still 'pass'"
          why2: "`probar test` only runs playbooks, not cargo test"
          why3: "No pre-flight compile check"
          why4: "Original design assumed separate cargo test runs"
          why5: "ROOT: No unified quality gate"

        title: "Version Sync Validation"
        description: |
          Validate that jugar-probar version in Cargo.toml matches the probar
          CLI version to prevent API mismatches.

          Root cause: whisper.apr used jugar-probar v0.2.0 but test file
          referenced types that only existed in planned v0.5.0.
        priority: high
        status: planned
        acceptance_criteria:
          - `probar version-check` validates dependency versions
          - Warns if jugar-probar major.minor != probar CLI
          - `probar test --strict-version` fails on mismatch
          - Documents version compatibility matrix

      - id: PROBAR-008
        title: "Diagnostic Mode for State Machine Logging"
        description: |
          Add verbose diagnostic mode that logs all state transitions,
          ring buffer stats, and partial result flow for debugging.

          Root cause: Worker state mismatches were undetected because
          processAudio returned early silently when state != Processing.
        priority: high
        status: planned
        acceptance_criteria:
          - `probar test --diagnostics` enables verbose logging
          - Logs all state machine transitions with timestamps
          - Shows ring buffer read/write stats
          - Captures partial result events
          - Output format: JSON for machine parsing

      - id: PROBAR-009
        title: "Partial Verification Flag"
        description: |
          Add flag to verify intermediate results, not just final state.
          This catches issues where partial transcription results don't
          appear in the UI during recording.

          Root cause: Playbook tests verified final transcription existed
          but never checked that partials were displayed during recording.
        priority: high
        status: planned
        acceptance_criteria:
          - `probar test --verify-partials` checks intermediate states
          - Asserts partial_count > 0 within 500ms of speech
          - Verifies partial_text updates visible in DOM
          - Fails if only final result appears (no streaming feedback)

        title: "95% Test Coverage Gate"
        description: |
          Achieve and enforce 95% test coverage across all probar crates.
          Current coverage: 89.26% -> 90.68% (after extensive unit test additions)

          Progress (2026-01-08 session):
          - tarantula.rs: 74.69% -> ~100% (added 27 tests)
          - lint.rs: added 40+ tests for directory traversal, all lint categories
          - tracing.rs: added 20+ tests for all trace categories
          - simulation.rs: added tests for FailureInjection, InjectionType
          - statistics.rs: added tests for VarianceTree::from_samples()
          - visualization.rs: added tests for ExportFormat variants
          - load_testing.rs: added test for from_scenario()
          - wasm_testing.rs: added tests for Recording save/load
          - stress.rs: added tests for StressMode Display/FromStr
          - clock.rs: added test for ClockOptions::default()
          - main.rs: improved 26% -> 44% (added 80+ tests)
          - debug.rs: improved 33% -> 70% (added 14+ tests)

          Remaining gaps (integration code requiring browser/CLI):
          - browser.rs: 28% (827 lines - browser automation via CDP)
          - main.rs: 44% (1420 lines - CLI entry points, subprocess)
          - runner.rs: 63% (94 lines - process execution)
          - dev_server.rs: 71% (314 lines - HTTP server)
          - driver.rs: 81% (83 lines - browser driver)

          BLOCKER: 95% total coverage requires integration test infrastructure:
          1. Browser automation tests (Chrome/Firefox CDP)
          2. CLI integration tests (subprocess execution)
          3. HTTP server tests (dev_server.rs)
          These cannot be achieved with unit tests alone.
        priority: critical
        status: in_progress
        acceptance_criteria:
          - Total coverage >= 95% (or 95% excluding integration code)
          - validators.rs >= 95% (synchronous code)
          - zero_js.rs >= 95% (synchronous code)
          - watch.rs >= 95%
          - CI blocks PRs below threshold

        title: "Zero Lint Warnings"
        description: |
          Fix all clippy warnings to achieve zero-warning builds.
          COMPLETED: Fixed unreadable_literal in comprehensive_tests.rs
          (9007199254740991.0 -> 9_007_199_254_740_991.0)
        priority: high
        status: completed
        completed_at: "2026-01-07"
        acceptance_criteria:
          - `make lint` produces zero warnings ✓
          - CI fails on any new warnings
          - All `#[allow(...)]` annotations documented
